        <p class="frm_p">Ragini Dairy Farm is a brand of Heritage Milk Production, 
        is a one-of-its-kind, farm-to-home milk, from Central Indiaâ€™s most modern
        dairy farm, located in Uttarahalli, Bangalore, Karnataka.</p>

        <p class="frm_p">The farm is equipped with the finest technology. For processing and 
        packaging, state of art machines are used. </p>

        <p class="frm_p">Ragini Dairy Milk is 100% Pure, Pasteurised & Homogeneous milk which
        is Antibiotic-free and Hormone-free. Milk is packed in 0.5 litre packets and delivered to
        at your doorstep. Ragini Dairy Milk is entirely natural, unadulterated and untouched by 
        hand. The milk directly flows from the cows to the processing unit and packaged for 
        delivery, so that the milk cannot not been altered in any way. We do not add anything to 
        it nor do we take anything out of it.</p>

        <p class="frm_p">The milk comes from a select breed of cows, who are housed in comfortable
        sheds with round the clock veterinary care. The cows are fed with green grass fodder and 
        other required nutrition. As we cultivate green grass in-house, it is free from any 
        chemicals. The cows also have free access to clean drinking water. Our nutritionists 
        ensure that the cows are fed the best possible fodder mix with the right balance of
        essential nutrients. We never use hormones or other substances to artificially increase 
        milk production.</p>

        <p class="frm_p">We are committed to international standards of product quality.</p>
